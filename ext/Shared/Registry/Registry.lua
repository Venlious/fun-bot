		<!> Modifications to this file should not be made unless you know what you are doing.

		Welcome to the fun-bots registry. This file contains config-like variables related to the mod, such as versions and API-related stuff,
		but also important variables related to bots.
		These variables should not be configured by the end-user. The development team and CI/CD should set these variables to their correct value.
		As such, modifications to these variables are not supported by the fun-bots development team. Changing them is not recommended.
